# random-bitesize

Discover BBC Bitesize pages at random

## Wha?

Web server which serves up random page from BBC Bitesize on each request to http://localhost:3000/

## Uh?

Just have a go, it's pretty self explanatory.

```
npm install
npm run data
npm start
```

*NB: You can configure which port it starts by setting the PORT environment variable.*

## Feeling lazy?

-Just use my install: http://random-bitesize.herokuapp.com/-

## A wittle bit too random?

Try http://localhost:3000/daily

## HTML? Yuck!

Pah. Though of that. Try:  /json, /xml or /go

## Um, can I...

Sure, if you wanna fork, push PRs, etc -- go right ahead. Comes with no warranty nor rights. This is not an official BBC thing; It's just wee fun thing.
